# Creality K2 Plus Powerups

Repo to test my ideas for improving the leveling and print start for the Creality K2

## Reasoning

As I have started to work with high temp filaments, I have noticed issues and deficiencies with the printer. One of the silly issues is the fact that chamber heating takes forever (if it actually reaches the target temp) with forced probe enables.
